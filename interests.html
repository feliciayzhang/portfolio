    <h1 id = "main">My Interests and Hobbies</h1>
    <p>Here are some of my interests and hobbies.</p>
    <p>My number 1 hobby would be music. I am in no way a 'serious' musician or
      anything, but I enjoy music in all forms. I mean, who doesn't? I have been
      playing the piano since I was 5 years old, and I have learned other
      instruments as well, including the flute, guitar, and the motley of
      instruments that are found in an orchestral band's percussion section. I am
      very thankful for having the opportunity to learn these instruments because
      they have given me a huge appreciation for music as a whole and have taught
      me the importance of hard work.
    <p>Besides learning music, I love listening to music, singing in the shower,
      and having private dance parties to myself. Music is beautiful in that it
      can unite people without any sort of barrier. It is a universal language. </p>
    <p>I also like to play tennis in my free time, go on runs (sometimes!), and
      do Zumba! Besides physical activity, I also love watching TV, learning Chinese,
      and online shopping (does that count as a hobby? haha). </p>
    <p>I've been reflecting on what I have been able to accomplish in this past
      year due to lockdown, and I can say that I wasn't really able to succeed
      in any of my quarantine goals (besides watching some animes that I had
      been meaning to finish). Hopefully this upcoming summer I can take
      some time to be more crafty and artsy which is what I had been hoping to
      last summer.</p>
