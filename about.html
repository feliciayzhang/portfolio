    <p>I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, about 2 hours west of
      Ann Arbor. I have never lived anywhere else until I moved to Ann Arbor for
      college.</p>
    <p>I am excited to attend graduate school in the fall at the University of
      Michigan School of Information and School of Public Health and learn about
      ways to improve health outcomes through using data and information!</p>
    <p>A little more about me...</p>
    <p>My number 1 hobby would be music. I am in no way a 'serious' musician or
      anything, but I enjoy music in all forms. I mean, who doesn't? I have been
      playing the piano since I was 5 years old, and I have learned other
      instruments as well, including the flute, guitar, and the motley of
      instruments that are found in an orchestral band's percussion section. I am
      very thankful for having the opportunity to learn these instruments because
      they have given me a huge appreciation for music as a whole and have taught
      me the importance of hard work.
    <p>Besides learning music, I love listening to music, singing in the shower,
      and having private dance parties to myself. Music is beautiful in that it
      can unite people without any sort of barrier. It is a universal language. </p>
    <p>I also like to play tennis in my free time, go on runs (sometimes!), and
      do Zumba! Besides physical activity, I also love watching TV, learning Chinese,
      and online shopping (does that count as a hobby? haha). </p>
    <p>Lastly, I would like to talk about my favorite movie Ponyo - I think anyone
      who reads this should go and watch this movie; it is one of the most beautiful
      movies I've ever watched. You won't regret it!</p>
